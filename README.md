# python-unicode-converter
Literally <a href="https://github.com/Izzami/unicode-converter">unicode-converter</a> but written in python. 

The only interesting thing is that the program has been completely converted to python using <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">ChatGPT</a> by <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>.

**What's that?**

A minimal program to convert glyph characters to Unicode codes
## Adding characters
At the moment only characters from 32 to 126 (dec) are included. You can add more characters by simply adding them into the <a href="table.txt">"table.txt"</a> file using the right order (*glyph and decimal code are optional*):
> U+0000  x     nu

## Known Issues

- The file <a href="table.txt">"table.txt"</a> **MUST** stay in the same directory as the program.
